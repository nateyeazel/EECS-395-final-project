>> However, in my travels as a younger man, I happened across an old abandoned castle in the middle of France.
>> It looked as though no one had been there for hundreds of years. 
>> When I went inside, I saw an ornate altar glimmering in the single beam of sunlight that broke through the hole in the ceiling.
>> Upon it, there lay a small red stone, transparent and shimmering like glass 
-- Explain that you discovered the secret to immortality

Don Ricardo ("gasping"):  ... The Philosopher's Stone!

Gabriel (replying): Indeed! So you now see that you can not hope to live up to me! With the stone, I was able to recover from your cowardly trick, and now it's time to finish this once and for all!
-- Finish your tale

(ab) Gabriel: As I was lying there in that seaside hospital, halfway to the gates of heaven, I heard the firing of cannons in the distance.

>> It was none other than the dread pirate ship the Black Skull, captained by the Dread Pirate Smith!
>> They raided the island the hospital was on, leaving me no choice but to stowaway in their ship.
-- Say that you joined a roving gang of pirates

Anyone except Gabriel: But how did you get here?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Gabriel: After stowing away I considered my options, and decided that I would need to infiltrate their crew to survive.
>> Eventually I claimed the title of Dread Pirate Smith for myself.
-- Say you took over the ship.
